weight, activity level by the on boarding screen. The it shows a dash board where
the data is displayed via easy to under stand visual graphs.

app is made using clean architecture and MVVM architecture. Some of the android apis
that are used are : -

1) Retrofit - to load food data from open food api

4) viewModels
5) coroutines, etc
